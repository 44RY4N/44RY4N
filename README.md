##  About Me

Third-year Computer Science undergrad. I combine **front-end creativity with backend logic** to create apps that *work smart and scale clean*.

Currently diving deep into **Node.js, Express, modular backend architecture**, and **API design**, while continuing to explore **Three.js**, **modern frontend patterns**, and **AI logic** in web-based projects.

##  Skills & Tools

###  Languages:

* **C**, **Python**, **Java**, **SQL**
* **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript (ES6)**
* **React**, **jsPDF**, **Three.js**

###  Backend:

* **Node.js**, **Express.js**
* **REST API Development**
* **MVC Architecture**
* Middleware & Routing
* Learning **MongoDB** (schema design & integration)

###  Front-End:

* **React** – Component-driven UI architecture using Hooks & modern patterns
* Scalable state management & reusable component systems
* Dynamic forms, validation & controlled inputs
* REST API integration & async data handling
* Performance-aware rendering & clean UI logic

UI & Interaction Design:

* Responsive layouts (Flexbox, Grid)
* Motion & 3D UI (GSAP, Three.js)
* Modular CSS architecture
* Accessibility & UX-focused validation

###  Developer Workflow:

* Git & GitHub (version control, branching, project setup)
* NPM, Webpack (custom configs), ES6 Modules
* JSON Handling, Async/Await, Promises, Fetch API
* VS Code, Live Server, Prettier, ESLint

### 📈 Algorithms & AI:

* DSA (Recursion, Graphs, Sorting, Pathfinding)
* Optimization: PSO, Genetic Algorithm (Lunar Lander project)
* Game AI: Minimax (Tic-Tac-Toe), State-based AI (Battleships)

##  Notable Projects

###  **Intours API** *(Backend Project)*

**Tech:** Node.js, Express.js, MVC Architecture *(MongoDB integration in progress)*

* Built a **modular REST API** following clean **MVC architecture**.
* Structured controllers, routes, and services for scalability.
* Focused on readable, maintainable backend code.
* Designed with future database integration and expansion in mind.
