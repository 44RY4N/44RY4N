## 🚀 About Me

I'm a 2nd-year Computer Science student with a strong foundation in problem solving and a growing passion for crafting beautiful, responsive, and interactive web applications.

I’ve built multiple front-end projects that demonstrate mastery in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API handling, and Git workflows. My focus lies in writing modular, scalable code with clean design patterns and the **SOLID principles**.
