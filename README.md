## 🚀 About Me

I'm a 2nd-year Computer Science student with a strong foundation in problem solving and a growing passion for crafting beautiful, responsive, and interactive web applications.

I’ve worked on several front-end projects that show my command over HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and Git workflows. I enjoy implementing scalable, modular code with clean design patterns and the **SOLID principles**.

### 🧠 Soft Skills

- **Rapid Debugging Ability** – Quickly identify and resolve both layout and logic issues across HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Attention to Detail** – Obsessive about small UX touches: animations, transitions, UI responsiveness, and accessibility.
- **Creative Problem Solving** – Frequently introduce unique UI/UX features like sliding form doors, theme toggles, or 3D transitions.
- **High Design Ownership** – Invest time in polishing projects, prioritizing quality over shortcuts.
- **Scalability-Focused Thinking** – Modular architecture and SOLID principles are visible in large projects like the To-Do List.
- **Perseverance & Self-Motivation** – Bounce back from setbacks and channel energy into building cleaner, more refined code.
- **Proactive Learner** – Explore beyond course content (animations, Minimax AI, Webpack, etc.) and apply them in creative ways.
- **Version Control Fluency** – Maintain clean GitHub repositories with proper commit messages, README files, and live demos.
