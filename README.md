## 🚀 About Me

I'm a second-year Computer Science undergrad who’s obsessed with building visually appealing, responsive web projects and solving logic-heavy challenges. I combine my knowledge of algorithms with front-end creativity to create apps that *work smart and look sharp*.

Currently diving deep into **JavaScript**, **Three.js**, **modular architecture**, and exploring **AI logic** in web-based games.

## 🧠 Skills & Tools

### 👨‍💻 Languages:
- **C**, **Python**, **Java**, **SQL**
- **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript (ES6)**
- **React**, **jsPDF**, **ThreeJs**

### 🎨 Front-End:
- Responsive Design using `%`, `em`, `rem`, `vh/vw`
- CSS Grid, Flexbox & 3D Transforms
- Animations: CSS Keyframes, GSAP
- Form Validation (HTML5 & JS), Accessibility
- DOM Manipulation, Modular Architecture (ES6)
- Three.js & WebGL (Intermediate level)

### ⚙️ Developer Workflow:
